Construct a simple questionnaire runner:

The questionnaire should ask a series of yes/no questions based on the question data below.
When the questionnaire is run it should ask the below questions and record a Yes/No answer.
Answers will need to be persisted so they can be used in calculations for subsequent runs.
At the end of the test run it should give a rating out of 100 for the current run:

(100 * number of Yes answers / number of questions)

as well as an average rating for all runs.
